<h1>App Installer For Windows 8.x</h1>
<p>This application aims to provide a more elegant way to install Windows Store apps. It offers a visual window for users to browse app information, install, launch apps, or get error details.</p>
<p>When using the App Installer to install the package, the certificates in the package will be automatically imported, eliminating the need for manual import and greatly simplifying the installation of Windows Store apps.</p>
<p>However, note that other programs included in the project's installer package, besides the App Installer, will not automatically import their certificates. Fortunately, the App Installer supports automatic installation parameters.</p>
<p>Supports running on Windows 8 and later.</p>
<h2>Required runtime libraries</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4.5 (may be pre-installed on Windows 8.x and later)</li>
  <li>Microsoft .NET Framework 4.6 (x86/ARM)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable (x86/ARM)</li>
  <li>Microsoft Visual C++ 2015 Redistributable (x86/ARM)</li>
  <p>Note: Windows 8.x on ARM devices may require an update to install the VC2015 runtime library.</p>
</ul>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>Download the latest release from the Releases section.</p>
<a href="https://github.com/modernw/App-Installer-For-Windows-8.x-Reset/releases" target="_blank"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/modernw/App-Installer-For-Windows-8.x-Reset"></a>
<p>Note: Ensure that .NET Framework 4.6 is installed on your computer, as the runtime libraries automatically installed by the installer may not actually be installed on your system. Therefore, after completing the installation via the installer, be sure to download and run the .NET Framework 4.6 runtime library installer again.</p>
<p>Note 2: The x86 runtime library must be installed, as the program itself is compiled for the x86 architecture. (Unless the program is compiled for the ARM architecture, in which case the ARM runtime library must be installed.)</p>

<h2>Attention</h2>
<ul>
  <li><del>This program is an x86 program, not an ARM application, not cross-platform, and cannot be used on Windows RT.</del></li>
  <li>The program uses some third-party libraries and other GitHub projects, and is completed with the assistance of AI (ChatGTP). This project can be used for learning and communication purposes.</li>
  <li>(Important) Internet Explorer must support TLS 1.2 (requiring the use of IE's XMLHttpRequest to retrieve update information), especially IE10. You can do this by opening the "Advanced" tab in Control Panel/Internet Explorer's "Internet Options," finding "Use TLS 1.2" and checking the box, then clicking "OK" and saving. The settings will take effect the next time you open the browser.<br><img width="300" height="395" alt="屏幕截图 2025-12-08 103450" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/69ee21ca-7f47-4d56-8dde-37e5704776c1" /></li>
